## status: accepted
## date: 05-21-23 when the decision was last updated
## deciders: Mick and Jenny
## consulted: Professor Powell, TA Akshay
## informed: all team members
## Context and Problem Statement: We need to decide how would we distribute works in our team 

# Why this decision?

## Considered Options
- Split team into backend and frontend subteams 
- Pair up team members (1 prefer front end 1 prefer backend) and distrbute work based on feature

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen option: Split team into backend and frontend subteams

### Details
- We choose to split our team into 2 subteams which is Backend and Frontend. Frontend will have 5 people under the lead of Mick while backend will have 3 people under the lead of Jenny. 
- We decide the the assignment of each member by asking for their own preference and also evaluate their technical experience. We first give everyone a chance to choose what they want and adjust the team accordingly to make sure that each team is balance. 
- Each co-lead will be in charge of one sub team and have the responsiblity to keep the communication between teams up to date and make sure no one fall behind. 
- We will divde the work by features. For example, for the feature display the card on result page, the frontend team will have to write the html and css code to display a blank card name and image on the website in both desktop and mobile version. The backend will work on actually display with the data form json file. 


### Consequence 
- Good, becuase each member can work individually or pair up with one teammates in the same subteam if they prefer so. They also have the choice to work on the feature that they are into and have the opportunity to also communicate with other subteam as they might also work on the same features. 
- Good, because co-lead can easliy keep track of the progress and distribute works for everyone 
- Bad, because it is a bit troublesome when handling branches. 
- Bad, because backend have to wait for frontend to be done in order to get start.



## Pros and Cons of the Options
### Split team into backend and frontend subteams 
- Good, because By spliting the team into 2 subteams, it will be easiler for the co-lead to manage the workloads and also take care of the team members as it will be easier to assigned work and communicat in smaller time. Hence we have a co-lead in each subteam, who will make sure everyone track and it will be easier to check in if your team is smaller. It is also ideal because it will be eaiser to set up a common meeting time for subteam compare to the big tema.
- Good, because each team members will have a chance to share their prefered position and we will assign them accordingly. Spliting into 2 team will also give the members to work on something that they are interested in or have more experience in.
- Good, Having 2 teams also mean that the branches in github will also split as the task is distributed based on the team. This will save us a lot of time since there will be less merge conflict as everything is mostly resolved inside the subteam in a smaller scope and there won't be much conflict in the final merge since frontend and backend work on different file. Main branch is also protected this way because the change are mostly local on the front end or back end branch. Anything change to those branches will not affect the main branch. 
- Bad, because Backend team will have to wait on the Frontend team to be done with their work in order to start. Backend need the interface before starting so it is also one step behind frontend. 
- Bad, becuase when there is errors, the teammates from both subteam will have to maintain good communicate or else they might have conflict when merge or push. 

### Pair up team members (1 prefer front end 1 prefer backend)
- Good, because there will be less merge or push conflict because all the works are based on features and most of the time they are not related to each other. 
- Good, because team members can work on the features that they like
- Bad, because it will be hard for the leads to keep track of the works adn distributed the works. Members will be in charge of their own works and will have to create their own isues and keep track of their own works. If communication is not maintain, then members might be slack off and the team will fall behind. 
- Bad, because members on the team will have a hard time understand what is going on with other aspect of the project other than the features that they are assigning to. And this might create a bus factor since if the both member of charge of a features can't do their tasks anymore, no one will understand what is going to keep it on. 
- Bad, because there might be an inbalance when pair up 2 members. And it will be hard to switch around later on because each members have their own assigned tasks already.
