## Issues
_Since our sprints are structured such that this sixth sprint is at the exact end of the quarter (i.e., heavily overlapping with the code cutoff date), these issues are essentially a roadmap
for future development._

### This sprint
- Create private and public videos for final presentation and submission

### Future Development
- Mobile development
  - Create Figma designs for layout [Done âœ“]
  - Convert home page to mobile layout
  - Convert solo mode to mobile layout
  - Convert versus lobby to mobile layout
  - Convert versus game board to mobile layout
  - User test with new mobile layout
- Practice mode
  - Wire up initial logic for simulated opponent actions by just selecting a random card each move
  - Create more advanced strategies
  - Add user ability to customize the strategy that they oppose
- Other
  - Convert the settings to menu a SPA-style page instead of it's own .html file
    - We just didn't get around to implementing this (or rather, as cleanly as we would like), but it would be advantageous. Namely, the current set up with the settings menu is slightly jank, as it requires the user to essentially leave and rejoin the game if they want to access the settings from versus mode.
