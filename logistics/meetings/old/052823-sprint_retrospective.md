How can we improve Mastery?
1. Had to use a lot of outside resources for testing framework. Need thorough investigation to perfect it.
2. Sometimes, CSS can be hard to deal with. We should checkout code examples and read MDN documentations to perfect it.
   
How can we improve Meaning?
1. We can improve meaning of our project by adding a Game-ifying component to the game play.
2. WIP: User clicks on a card to select a damage from a progress bar, and result in different number of cards every game.
