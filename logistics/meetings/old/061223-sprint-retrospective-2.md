## Details
What do we think of the project as we wrap it up?
### Sad Mad Glad
#### Sad
 - To see our opponent go away as we implemented a new game play
 - Removing draymond green
 - Wasn’t be able to add a background music to our project
 - Say goodbye to the team
 - Some small fixes could have also been added
 - Missing sound effects
 - wanted to add more features to camera design page and to results buts didn’t have time
 - that its over
 - not able to add some features
 - improve on some UI (like add logo)
 - not making my ui components prettier
 - not working with backend/js
 - sad that we didn't get to implement all the features we were thinking of because of time (speech synthesis, different languages, settings function, different themes)
 - not getting to include the camera test
#### Mad
 - sometimes had weird client side(?) bugs throughout development
 - mad that there are still some tiny bugs (such as scroll bar appearing when hovering over card on bottom row) that appeared out of no where
#### Glad
 - glad that we have more tests now
 - glad that we were able to address the user needs
 - We have a better gameplay than before, UI on different pages are all amazing
 - we found a game design we liked and made a product we can be proud of.
 - The gameplay was improved and the changes were implemented quickly and well
 - I got to learn and build something I have never done before with a team of amazing people
 - we made something were proud of and learned a lot
 - Learn a lots, and the application improve a lot over a short period of time
 - we have a largely bug free experience for the user, learned a lot for my first time working on a web dev project
 - glad that we were able to incorporate gameplay with fortune telling and created a final product we're proud of
 - Home stretch of this experience. Learned a lot about web design and working in the team and hopefully improved throughout the quarter

## Conclusion
- It's sad to say goodbye and we could have done more, but great job team!
