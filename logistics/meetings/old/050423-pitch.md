## Details

### 1. Directions from Akshay
- Having a strong architectural choices and their documentation is important 
  - [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/ )
- Use of Web APIs[link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API)
- Need to deploy at the end (Github Pages, etc but to the web)
- Network information API can check whether client has internet connection or not
- Image Capture API for using webcam [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream_Image_Capture_API )
- Development suggestion 
  - Keep it local-first for the first interation 
- Testing 
  - Puppeteer 
  - Cypress
  - Screenshots of before/after expected results(?) -- apparently called diff-testing 
- De-risk as much as possible 
  - Explore multiple choice options 
  - Ex: for Akshay 210, their de-risk is by exploring multiple framework options: Flutter, Web,...
- Progressive Web App (prof like this apparently)
  - https://youtu.be/sFsRylCQblw 
  - Make it downloadable on mobile devices as an app (prob only Android)
  - Even if app is simple, presentation of final product and documentations are more important
